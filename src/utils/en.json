  "about1": "With the expected increase of the population that lives in the urban cities, the concept of a smart city is becoming more concrete due to the necessity of  adaptation, considering its sustainability and competitiveness.",
  "about2": "The hope is that modern society will be able to deal with the multitude of issues that urban inhabitants are already facing, which will doubtless be further exacerbated as cities continue to expand.",
  "about3": "Therefore, instead of traveling to the city hall to register an occurrence, the user may have a 24-hour service that is portable and  easier to create events. Its proficiency and facility to get into a smartphone is a plus point to encourage the citizens to use it, thus using existing resources to make the city smarter. This service will be the application (mobile and web) built within the scope of this thesis, which allows to record the occurrences efficiently.",
  "about4": "In this way, Artificial Intelligence will perform an important role in this field, since it recognizes patterns and, in an efficient way, find and suggest better solutions, which will be applied with a machine learning method in order to anticipate occurrences to make the city proactive, trying to anticipate and solve their problems in advance.",
